# ChatBot_using_Tflearn
This project was about building Chatbot with a json file containing intents as the input. 
Intents.json has a set of queries with respective tags in order to group similar queries with appropriate responses.
This helps in training the model. 
Web application can be built on top of it, here the main model was just potrayed.

Main packages used here:
Tflearn, Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow
